# NHV Song Mashups
Song mashup fulfilling the creative project requirement of NHV (Nature and Human Values) at Colorado School of Mines.

## Inspiration
This style of mashup was inspired by the song T.I.M.E. on the “Mouth Moods” album (Niel Cicierega) where he added
the Y.M.C.A. (Village People) vocals on top of Time (Hans Zimmer). In this odd combination he
conveys a deeper meaning, or at least a different message, than the two pieces would do
individually. The first time listening to this kind of mashup can be quite jarring, so I would
recommend listening to [Mouth Moods](http://www.neilcic.com/mouthmoods/) first.  

## Song choice
The background of Time (Hans Zimmer) from Inception highlights the irreversibility of time and the effects of our decisions. This track is kept fully intact and unmodified (sans trimming to make it fit the presentation constraints) as no process can change the inevitable passage of time. The first 20 seconds of the song only contains time to highlight that there was a time without humans, or even Earth if we look far enough backwards. Also, the movie Inception deals heavily with the theme of unintended consequences, many of which we are still dealing with today.  

The first overlay to start is Money (Pink Floyd), as money often motivates people to make unethical decisions. Money is then interrupted by “Wake Up” (Rage Against The Machine). I brought this song as it deals with ethical themes such as namely racism in America, and illustrates that people need to wake up and start doing something to help bring about the necessary change. The last words of the song mashup highlight that decisions now have an effect on the future: “How long? Not long, ‘cause what you reap is what you sow!” (Rage Against The Machine 5:50).

Our current obsession (Metallica “Battery”) as a species with consuming more and more resources is “Unsustainable” (Muse) and will most likely lead to an uncomfortable interruption to our way of life if not changed soon.  

With the weight of the world’s problems it would be insane to try to tackle it all alone. To highlight the importance of friendship, I got my friend (Glenn Moore) to whistle one of his favorite tunes as the final phrase of the mashup. Without friendship I could not have made it to where I am today.
