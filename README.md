# NHV-Song-Mashup
Song Mashup created as the creative project requirement for NHV. 
This specific style of mashup was inspired by the song T.I.M.E. on the “Mouth Moods” album (Niel Cicierega) where he added
the Y.M.C.A. (Village People) vocals on top of Time (Hans Zimmer). In this odd combination he
conveys a deeper meaning, or at least a different message, than the two pieces would do
individually. The first time listening to this kind of mashup can be quite jarring, so I would
recommend listening to [Mouth Moods](http://www.neilcic.com/mouthmoods/) first.
